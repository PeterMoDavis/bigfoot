# Bigfoot Encounters

## Description

A sort of silly simple app that I made to show the user their location on a map and show all descriptions of bigfoot sightings on that map. It was more frustrating than amusing to make but the "finished" app is ok. I would like to make it so that bigfoot sightings would only be displayed after and in the viciinity of the user. It wold also be nice if the user could search places on the map.

You can visit the app [HERE](https://petermodavis.github.io/bigfoot/)
